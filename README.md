# Langgraph Series

In this repository, I will be documenting my learning journey from basic to advanced concepts. The following files are currently included:

## Notebooks

- **hello_world_langgraph.ipynb**: Basic introduction to LangGraph fundamentals.
- **langgraph.ipynb**: Initial setup and package installations.
- **langgraph-2.ipynb**: Additional setup and package installations.
- **condiotional_edge.ipynb**: Working with conditional edges in LangGraph.
- **multiple_inputs.ipynb**: Handling multiple inputs in LangGraph workflows.
- **custom-tool.ipynb**: Creating and using custom tools in LangGraph.
- **Memory-component-with-langgraph.ipynb**: Implementing memory components in LangGraph applications.
- **coding_assistant.ipynb**: Building a coding assistant with LangGraph.
- **logic_assistant.ipynb**: Creating a logic-based assistant.
- **adaptive_rag.ipynb**: Building an adaptive RAG system using various embeddings and document loaders.
- **RAG-langgraph-ollama.ipynb**: Implementing RAG with LangGraph and Ollama.
- **langraph_email.ipynb**: Email processing and handling with LangGraph.
- **example_production_based_langgraph.ipynb**: Production-ready LangGraph implementation examples.
- **experiment.ipynb**: Experimental features and testing.

## Projects

- **reflection-agent/**: Agent implementation with reflection capabilities.
- **reflexion-agent/**: Advanced reflexion agent with custom schemas and chains.

More files will be added in the future as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills.

Stay tuned for updates!
