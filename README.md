# Langgraph Series

In this repository, I will be documenting my learning journey from basic to advanced concepts. The following files are currently included:

- **adaptive_rag.ipynb**: Building an index using various embeddings and document loaders.
- **coding_assistant.ipynb**: Loading documents and retrieving data from a specified URL.
- **langgraph-2.ipynb**: Initial setup and package installations.
- **langgraph.ipynb**: Additional setup and package installations.
- **RAG-langgraph-ollama.ipynb**: Code execution and output display.


More files will be added in the future as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills.

Stay tuned for updates!
